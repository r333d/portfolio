        <h1>Hello, I'm Daniel</h1>
        <p>I've been designing digital products since 2011. I redesigned 
          <a class="link-about" href="/kernel">Kernel's analysis tool</a> 
          for medical teams; I designed 
          <a class="link-about" href="/shootr-chat">Shootr’s Chat service</a>; and I helped to design 
          <a class="link-about" href="/niji">Telefonica’s Niji</a>.</p>
        <p class="text-about-mobile-hidden">Before, I enjoyed a few years of cold and northern lights 
          in the swedish Lapland. I studied a master in HCI; I researched about design for  
          <a class="link-about" href="/unobtrusive">unobtrusive interfaces</a>; and I designed for 
          brands such as <a class="link-about" href="http://www.imagomundiart.com/welcome/">Benetton</a> 
          and <a class="link-about" href="/sagogrynets">Swedish Television</a>
           at North Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Besides that I believe that technology can have a positive impact in the world. I am 
          passionate for data analysis and understanding new technologies, systems and bussineses. I use 
          this passion to invest in or design for the companies of the future.</p>
        <p>Currently I live in Barcelona, but originaly I’m from La Rioja, a small region in Spain.</p>

          <br><br>
          In April 2019, it had receded to an outdated and disorganized slew of features that made the 
          experience slow and complex to use. This is the story of how I was part of an ambitious project 
          to recreate Kernel.</p>

          <h1>Coming to a crossroad</h1>
          <p>Back in 2013, Kernel discovered that MSL teams didn’t have an easy way to showcase their most 
            valueable asset: medical insights. They learned that MSLs and Medical Directors were struggling 
            in spreadsheets or CRMs optimized for Sales. By 2019, Kernel website and mobile 
            app were used by over 50 MSL teams spread across 30 countries.
            <br><br>
            However, regarding the website, there were issues to scale alongside the size and needs of the 
            teams. Fundamental usability was challenged. Several unimportant features and experiments competed 
            for focus. Reliability and performance issues had increased. The website had become impossible to 
            update.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, the mobile app offered an incomplete experience as users were only able to add 
            information from their interactions with the experts.

          <h2>MSL, THE USER OF KERNEL</h2>
          <p>
            A Medical Science Liaison (MSL) is a role within the pharmaceutical and other health-care 
            industries. They discuss with physicians about products and data so physicians can choose the 
            best treatments for their patients. MSLs help to ensure that products are used effectively and 
            bring the expert feedback to the pharmaceutical company to guide future clinical trials and 
            product development.

          <p>At the outset of the project I didn’t have a clear mission or specific goals for the experience

            Kernel website but we decided to explore more and validate our assumptions.
            <br><br>
            We tested the existing Kernel website and app with 8 participants of the MSLs teams that were 
            already using Kernel. Our goals were to understand the challenges MSLs faced and the workarounds 
            they employed.

          <h1>Deeper Insights</h1>
          <p>I partnered with our data analyst to investigate how MSL teams were and how it was their 
            experience at scale.
            <br><br>
            The first goal was to validate the existing information architecture so we can build an experience 
            that works best for most users but considers edge cases too.
            <br><br>
            The second goal was to investigate the health of adding insights around all teams. What was the 
            perfect example of an interaction with a medical expert? The Add Interaction form asks MSLs to add 
            free text Insights and/or respond to previously defined Survey Questions. Users could add none or 
            multiple of each, from different Initiatives.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/kernel-9.png"
                data-src="../images/kernel-9.png" alt="Kernel">
          <h2>GREAT VARIETY OF TEAMS</h2>
          <p>Digging into the data revealed insights about how companies, teams and the content were organized. 
            There were a great variety between teams sizes, number of initiatives. We also discovered how 
            some users were part of different teams and different ways to use Initiatives. For example, MSLs 
            created new Iniatives for Medical Congresses that they attended; those Initiatives would be used 
            intensively for weeks and then become inactive.
            <br><br>
            Data also showed several problems that affected most teams. The overall trend was that the 
            experience was getting worse overtime as teams added more content and had more historical members 
            (although not all were active at the same time).
            <br><br>
            Many of these problems had a material impact not only in the overall experience but also in the 
            potential results that MSLs could achieve with Kernel. The issues affected them both at adding 
            feedback and at analysing the data.

        <h1>Reframing the problem</h1>
        <h5>Although the Kernel website was an improvement compared to spreadsheets or CRMs optimized 
          for sales, this wasn’t enough to fulfill MSLs needs. Kernel had important problems: adding 
          and analyse information, navigating trough the website, managing inactive content, allowing 
          team collaboration, a compelling mobile experience... This lead to fustration and wasted time.

          <br><br>
          It also gives MSLs data analysis tools and enables team collaboration within and without

          <h2>NEW NAVIGATION</h2>
          <p>The navigation has been redesigned. It’s easier and it feels simpler because everything 
            is where it makes sense to be. Some terms have also changed for words commonly used in the 
            healthcare industry, like Initiatives instead of Topics.
            <br><br>
            The information is presented just how MSLs work. The focus is on the information gathered 
            from leading physicians. The structure of the information is refined to enable a quickly 
            scan or a deep analysis.</p>

        <p>The new Add Feedback is called Add Interaction, and now it is fast and calm. 
          Unfinished Interactions are saved automatically in drafts to limit the risk of losing 
          any information.
          <br><br>
          The process is streamlined. Kernel makes sensible decisions for the users, informing 
          them in ways that are understandable and actionable, and enable them to past fast 
          through the most tedious parts.</p>

          and bring up the collaboration with the whole team. Add notes, change the filters, export 
          to PowerPoint and more, always saved and synced.</p>
        <h2>KERNEL IN MOBILE</h2>
        <p>The new Kernel brings the whole experience to Mobile. Not only the new website is more 
          accessible on all screen sizes, the new native app for iPhone, iPad and Android offers all 
          the features (except admin tools) adapted to each device.</p>
