        <h1>Hello, I'm Daniel</h1>
        <p>I've been designing digital products since 2011. I redesigned Kernel's analysis tool 
          for medical teams; I designed 
          <a class="link-about" href="/shootr-chat">Shootr’s Chat service</a>; and I helped to design 
          <a class="link-about" href="/niji">Telefonica’s Niji</a>.</p>
        <p class="text-about-mobile-hidden">Before, I enjoyed a few years of cold and northern lights 
          in the swedish Lapland. I studied a master in HCI; I researched about design for  
          <a class="link-about" href="/unobtrusive">unobtrusive interfaces</a>; and I designed for 
          brands such as <a class="link-about" href="http://www.imagomundiart.com/welcome/">Benetton</a> 
          and <a class="link-about" href="/sagogrynets">Swedish Television</a>
           at North Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Besides that I believe that technology can have a positive impact in the world. I am 
          passionate for data analysis and understanding new technologies, systems and bussineses. I use 
          this passion to invest in or design for the companies of the future.</p>
        <p>Currently I live in Barcelona, but originaly I’m from La Rioja, a small region in Spain.</p>

        <h2>How does Niji work</h2>
        <p>Niji is a service that users can forget that it exists while enjoying that their internet
          connection has additional features. The website offers statistics and multiple options
          to manage the features.
          <br><br>
          Once a user activate Niji, it looks at the data that comes from websites to block anything
          that the user does not want to, such as ads, trackers, or virus, before it reachs the user’s
          mobile. Niji does not look at data that is encrypted, such as websites with the protocol HTTPS,
          because one our core values is to support online privacy and security.
          <br><br>
          Some advantages against similar services are that users do not need to download any app on
          their phones and there is no impact on battery life or the general functioning of the device.</p>

      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>As UX designer, my responsability was to design how the product was going to be used by the
        user, including designing new features, user flows, UI, ensuring that the design was correctly
        implemented by the developers, and presenting my work to other members of the team  and skateholders.</p>

    <article class="tile tile-case-description">
        <h2>UX challenges</h2>
        <p>When I started in October 2015, the team was getting the product ready for our first trial with
          Telefónica employees.
          <br><br>
          Initial research showed that our potential users did not fully understand some of our value propositions,
          such as online privacy and security, and consequently they did not pay much attention to that. They related
          more with our other features regarding blocking ads and saving data. However, blocking ads was a major concern
          as Telefonica had numerous strategic advertising partnerships.
          <br><br>
          Another important challenge was to manage users expectations and technical limitations. Many websites and apps use
          the secure protocol HTTPS which means that data is encrypted and our service does not work. However, users were
          often not aware whether they were under HTTPS or, even if they knew, they expected our service to work.
          <br><br>
          In addition, ussability tests with users showed that users had several problems to navigate through the website and,
          overall, to understand the statistics and other information. Besides, it was very difficult to activate the service
          in our first trials.
          <br><br>
          During 1 year, we released 3 closed trials within different Mobile Operators and users: Telefonica employees, clients
          of Tuenti Spain, and clients of Movistar Peru. As we were integrated with each of the Mobile Operators in order to
          function, we had to adapt the service each time. Changes often involved to modify how some of our features work, users
          flows like activate the service, and the UI of our website.</p>
    </article>
    <figure class="tile tile-image">
      <img src="../images/niji-5-2.jpg"
        data-src="../images/niji-5-3.jpg" alt="Niji">
    </figure>
    <article class="tile tile-case-description">
        <h2>UX solutions</h2>
        <p>First, we designed new user flows, such as how to activate the service, and re-created the website with a completely
          different UI, style and navigation, tackling all the problems that we had seen in our research.
          <br><br>
          We created stories through the app that explained the importance of concepts such as online privacy, security, https and more.
          We changed the tone so the illustrations and writing felt closer and relatable to our users. Often, the goal was to create
          interest in learning rather than to explain everything. The tone and the approach was very well received and it was completely
          different from other security services of Telefonica.
          <br><br>
          We tested different versions of our feature for blocking advertising. The objective was to find the right balance between the
          corporate point of view and provide the most value to our users. We settled in blocking only the most annoying ads: pop-ups,
          auto-play videos and sounds. Not only those ads are annoying but they consume a lot of data.
          <br><br>
          Most of the changes implemented were well received according with our surveys, user interviews and raw usage data.</p>
      <div class="tile-case-description-second">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Niji began as a technical innovation. We created a commercial product in 1 year. Just before I left, we were getting ready
          to launch with other two subsidiaries of Telefónica. Also, the project had been funded to launch in 6 countries in 2017.
          This rapid grow and support is outstanding in a company like Telefónica.
          <br><br>
          The team received awards inside the company for excellent results and collaboration between different areas. For example, we got an
          award for our collaboration with Tuenti Spain, a Telefónica subsidiary, to launch the trial with them.</p>
